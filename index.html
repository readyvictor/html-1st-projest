    <h1>The best anime according to Vivek</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 anime of all time </h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Naruto </h3>
    <p>this is my favourite anime ever, It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.</p>
    <h3>Black clover</h3>
    <p>This anime is realy motivate me for my goal.Apart from the more standard elements of shonen power levels, rivalry, and teamwork, Black Clover highlights the importance of mentorship, family, and loyalty.</p>
    <h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
    <p>This anime also my favourite.Some Quotes <b>“To raise above monsters, we have to abandon our humanity. When we fight, we become fire with fire.”</b> And one more Quotes<b>“If you win,if you live, if you lose, if you die. If you don't fight, you can't win.”</b></p>
